This Python collection will establish a DASH stake against your Fireblocks wallet.
It was authored by a dunce, and under no circumstances should it be executed against any real asset.

The collection will establish a DASH Masternode using the Staked API. Once established, a transaction
will be created and signed, staking 1,000 DASH as collateral.

In order to proceed with this stake, collateral wallet details will be needed in order to 
transmit collateral, and payout details will be needed in order to receive staking proceeds.
